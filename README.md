# Lego Mosaic Maker

[Website is live! pictureswithbricks.com](https://pictureswithbricks.com)

This is a program designed to create Mosaics of your own photos. The program takes an image and gives you instructions similar to the official lego mosiacs as well as a parts list.
This was original designed for personal use, as I wanted to make mosaics of my favourite album covers. Once I realized that there was nothing I could find online that did what I 
was looking for, I decided to design something that anyone could easily use to do the same.

## Important Info

The program uses the template used for the current official lego Mosaics, such as The Beatles 31198 or Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe 31197. The mosaic size can be adjusted, but
only on a 16x16 scale since that is the size of the large plates that are used. I recommend cropping your image to fit on a 16x16 grid, or else your image will be transformed
to fit (ex. 600x600px (1:1) or 1000x750 (4:3)).

Pieces will have to be sourced yourself. Lego's official pick a brick is useful but only has a handful of colours, so Bricklink is probably the best alternative. I recommend 
comparing your parts list to that of Lego's offical mosaic parts list and purchasing one since that could potentially be cheaper than purchasing the bricks, plus it will already
include the 16x16 plates as well as the pieces for the frame. I purchased the World Map 31203 so I had enough plates to make 4 3x3 covers as well as a large number of 1x1 tiles to 
start with.

## Installation (WIP)

1. Download or clone the repository

## How To

1. Download the image you would like to make a mosaic.
2. Crop the image to an aspect ratio with integer numbers (Ex. 3x3, 2x4, etc) !! If you don't do this, part of your image might be cropped out!
3. Locate and upload the image using the 'Browse' button.
4. Select the width and height you would like to use that matches your image. For example, Lego uses a 3x3 grid of 16x16 plates for all mosaics except for the World Map, which uses 8x5.
5. Hit 'Submit'
6. Adjust colour sliders to your liking. For example, sometimes adjusting brightness can bring out sharper colours and remove unwanted colours.
7. When you are satisfied, hit the Download button. A PDF copy of instructions for building as well as required pieces will be downloaded to your computer, in the same folder as the program.
8. Enjoy building! :)
